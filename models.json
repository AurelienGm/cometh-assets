With no less than five cosmic combustion chambers powered by the two largest crystals ever hoarded by the Frens, this vessel sets the highest standard of mobility. The few that have seen the GHST in real life recall being left dazed by how it was seamlessly floating from one asteroid to the next with heavy bags under its hull.",
